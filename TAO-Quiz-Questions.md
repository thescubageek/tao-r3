## Temporal Orientation (T)
*Linear ↔ Cyclical*

**T1.** Over the long run, history tends toward improvement.

**T2.** Historical patterns primarily recur in cycles rather than moving toward an endpoint.

**T3.** Lasting change is chiefly cumulative progress rather than repetition.

**T4.** Societies should prioritize renewal of established patterns over pursuit of novelty.

**T5.** History will culminate in a decisive transformation.

**T6.** Time is best understood as oriented toward defined milestones and end-states.

**T7.** Across generations, the same types of events return with new faces.

**T8.** "Progress" is mostly a change of form; core problems recur.

**T9.** When preservation and innovation conflict, innovation should generally lead.

**T10.** Cyclical rhythms (seasons, rites, returns) are a more accurate model of time than linear advance.

## Agency Orientation (A)
*Deterministic ↔ Volitional/Participatory*

**A1.** Deliberate choice can substantially redirect life trajectories.

**A2.** Outcomes are largely fixed by structures (institutions, class, biology) beyond personal control.

**A5.** Well-designed systems decrease reliance on personal willpower.

**A6.** Chance and luck are dominant drivers of life outcomes.

**A7.** Decisive authority is sometimes necessary to avoid diffusion of responsibility.

## Ontological Continuity (O)
*Transcendent/Dualistic ↔ Immanent/Relational*

**O1.** Moral truths ultimately depend on a reality that is not created by humans.

**O2.** Meaning and value arise chiefly from right relationship among persons, communities, and the natural world.

**O3.** The highest good requires alignment with something beyond the human world.

**O4.** Treating "spiritual" and "material" as separate domains leads to error.

**O5.** Boundaries between self, others, and world are ultimately conventional.

**O6.** Moral authority properly descends from beyond human agreement.

**O7.** Nature is a sufficient ground for meaning and value.

**O8.** Claims of non-duality or mystical union indicate contact with something real.

**O9.** Human purpose is primarily obedience or service to a reality above the world.

**O10.** Truth claims should be justified within human inquiry without appeal to a transcendent source.
