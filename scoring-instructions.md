## Scoring Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Reverse-Scored Questions
The following questions need to be reverse-scored (subtract your rating from 8):
- **T2, T4, T7, T8, T10** (Cyclical orientation questions)
- **A2, A4, A6, A10** (Deterministic orientation questions)
- **O2, O4, O5, O7, O10** (Immanent/relational orientation questions)

### Step 2: Calculate Raw Scores
1. **For normal questions**: Use your rating as-is (1-7)
2. **For reverse questions**: Calculate `8 - your_rating`
   - Example: If you rated T2 as "5", your adjusted score is `8 - 5 = 3`

### Step 3: Calculate Axis Averages
- **T Score**: Average of all 10 T questions (after reversing T2, T4, T7, T8, T10)
- **A Score**: Average of all 10 A questions (after reversing A2, A4, A6, A10)  
- **O Score**: Average of all 10 O questions (after reversing O2, O4, O5, O7, O10)

### Step 4: Convert to TAO Coordinates
Transform your averages (1-7 scale) to TAO coordinates (-1 to +1 scale):

**T = (T_average - 4) / 3**
**A = (A_average - 4) / 3**  
**O = (O_average - 4) / 3**

- Example: If your T average is 5.5, then T = (5.5 - 4) / 3 = +0.5
- Example: If your A average is 2.8, then A = (2.8 - 4) / 3 = -0.4
- Example: If your O average is 4.0, then O = (4.0 - 4) / 3 = 0.0

## Interpretation

- **T Axis**: Higher scores (+1) indicate more linear/progressive orientation; lower scores (-1) indicate more cyclical orientation
- **A Axis**: Higher scores (+1) indicate more volitional/participatory orientation; lower scores (-1) indicate more deterministic orientation  
- **O Axis**: Higher scores (+1) indicate more immanent/relational orientation; lower scores (-1) indicate more transcendent/dualistic orientation

Your final TAO coordinates (T, A, O) can then be plotted in the 3D philosophical space to see which traditions and figures you align with most closely.
