# TAO Assessment Quiz Questions (v4)

Revised to align with the clarified metaphysical framework:

* **T:** Cyclical ↔ Linear one-life ontology
* **A:** Deterministic ↔ Volitional agency
* **O:** Transcendent ↔ Immanent (fixed ↔ evolving)
* “Progress” has been relocated to **O**, reflecting ontological evolution.

### Scoring

* Reverse items are scored `8 − response`.
* Axis score = `(mean − 4) / 3` → range [−1, +1].
